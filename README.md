# ChessBoardExercise
Recently I saw some devs trying to code a chessboard page using web frameworks. Since I'm an iOS Developer, I thought: well, why not make a micro app related to that same challenge?

## Functional Programming Attempt
Plot twist: Since I'm also studying the basics of functional programming I used function compositioning to assemble the entire UI. Naturally, not all functions would be considered pure because the way UIKit works, but the result was pretty cool, even though it can be improved a lot.
Bonus: I implemented some cool syntax sugar operators. They weren't needed, but why not, right?
